# This is a website in honor of Newt Scamander!

British magizoologist Scamander is on a stop-over in New York City on his way to Arizona, when several of his magical animals escape and he has to hunt them down. This proves to be more difficult than expected.

## Scamander's characteristic traits:

* He has a special gift with wild animals
* Much less so with fellow human beings
* He is somewhat shy but charming

As Newt Scamander puts it:

>My philosophy is that worrying means you suffer twice.
